## Reasons of this project
This project has been developped as part of my portfolio. This idea comes from another repository (https://github.com/jruffet/qcmffvl) but have a complete different structure following my goals.

To build this project, Javascript and Tailwind CSS has been used. The first focus has been around vanilla javascript. The choice of Tailwind was purely to avoid manually writing any CSS style as I wanted to free my brain power for Javascript as it was my first project I entirely design the code myself from the knowledge I have gained from Youtube tutorial and FreeCodeCamp. This is also the first time I use Tailwind CSS framework. I am still discovering the strenght of this framework.

Second focus of this project will be how to manage the backend with data to populate the Mock Exam.
